\abstract{%
    The software package PROFESSOR~\cite{Buckley:2009bj} provides machinery to
    facilitate Monte-Carlo (MC) event-generator tuning.  The method is based on
    a numerical optimisation of a goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure defined between
    measured experimental data and MC predictions. As the latter are typically
    very expensive to evaluate, PROFESSOR replaces them with fast to evaluate
    surrogates. We present improvements to the method in the numerical
    optimisation as well as the surrogate construction. Firstly, we introduce
    an algorithm and implementation of a bi-level optimisation problem aimed at
    improving scenarios were the underlying physics model is unable to describe
    all data to the same accuracy. Secondly, we display our implementation of
    an algorithm for multivariate rational approximations which are superior to
    the previously used polynomial surrogates.
